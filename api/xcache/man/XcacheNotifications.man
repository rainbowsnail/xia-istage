.SH DESCRIPTION
Xcache Notifications is a mechanism used by Xcache Daemon to notify
applications about the happening of events. Applications register to
the events of their interest by calling
.I XregisterNotification
function.
The argument
.I event
is the event for which the application is registering. Following
events are supported.

.B "XCE_CHUNKARRIVED"
.RS
Chunk arrived.
.RE
.B "XCE_CHUNKEVICTED"
.RS
Chunk evicted.
.RE

Applications can register to multiple events by a single call to
.I XregisterNotification().
This achieved by setting
.I events
to bitwise-OR of multiple events.
The argument
.I func
is a function pointer to the function that needs to be invoked on
happening of any event in set
.I events.
.I func
knows about the exact event in its first argument
.I event.
.I func
knows about the CID of the chunk on which that particular event
happened as the second argument
.I cid.
.I cid
is of length
.I cidlen.

Xcache sends these notifications on
.B XcacheHandle->notifSocket.
Function
.B XprocessNotification()
parses the incoming notification and invokes appropriate registered
function. Applications interested in using Xcache notifications, wait
for incoming data by calling
.B select()
like functions.

.SH RETURN VALUE
On success
.B XregisterNotification()
returns 0. On failure it returns -1.
.B XprocessNotification()
returns the number of notifications received.
.SH ERRORS
.B ENOTCONN
XcacheSock is not connected.

.B EHOSTDOWN
